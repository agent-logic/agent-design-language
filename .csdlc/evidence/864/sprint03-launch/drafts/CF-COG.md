# [v0.92.2][CodeFriend Beta 1][CF-COG] Report evidence-linked repository structure

## One complete result

An operator invokes the installed `adl codefriend` architecture-report path on an admitted repository packet and receives evidence-linked dependency, layering, coupling and connascence findings. This task owns the usable structure reporter, not drift, impact or rationale analysis.

Build a bounded Rust graph from admitted source/manifest evidence, with explicit node/edge provenance and an explicit boundary model. Distinguish directly observed dependency facts from inferred layering/coupling/connascence. Do not infer missing external edges or architectural correctness from a score. Persist output through the shared finding/run contract for downstream analysis and report consumers.

## Complete executed acceptance

1. Execute the production architecture path against known graph fixtures containing an allowed layering pattern, forbidden dependency/cycle and a bounded coupling/connascence case. Findings identify exact evidence objects, source locations, revision, inference, confidence or unknown, and an actionable explanation.
2. Demonstrate the actual `repository_structure_reporter` receives CF-EVIDENCE-admitted packets and produces persisted findings consumed by the product artifact path; a test-only graph builder or authored report is insufficient.
3. Unsupported language constructs, unresolved external dependencies, truncated scope and malformed/tampered evidence produce explicit partial/unknown/error outcomes. Never present an incomplete graph as a complete architecture assessment.
4. Review a fixed positive/negative sample, retain expected outcomes, false positives and reviewer calibration decisions. Repeat identical inputs deterministically. Explain limits on connascence detected from this selected bounded Rust analysis.
5. Preserve canonical identities and deterministic graph ordering without following repository scripts, hidden network requests or source mutation.

## Concrete ownership and integration

Selected production module: `adl/src/codefriend/architecture/structure.rs` (new path, not existing functionality). Wire the corresponding capability into `adl/src/cli/codefriend_cmd.rs`, registered by `adl/src/cli/mod.rs`, with help in `adl/src/cli/usage.rs` and library registration in `adl/src/lib.rs`. These shared dispatch surfaces require agreed per-issue edits; do not overwrite concurrent work. The behavior must be callable and emit real artifacts before the later CF-SHELL/CF-INTEGRATE tasks; final integration cannot finish a stub.

Focused tests belong under `adl/tests/codefriend_cf_cog.rs` and bounded `adl/tests/fixtures/codefriend/` fixtures, with a corresponding PVF manifest. These are selected new test paths. Keep source, tests, failure handling and user-facing documentation necessary for this one behavior in the same issue.

## Dependency and authority

Execution prerequisites: CF-EVIDENCE, with accepted merged output before dependent execution. Creation in sprint batch 3 does not authorize bypassing dependencies. Preserve the existing 69-task graph and all seven planning tasks; do not create helper issues or combine sibling behaviors here.

Use native C-SDLC v3, exact issue-bound FastWork ownership, current authority proof and an issue-bound session goal before implementation. Re-resolve active shared-path owners. Root main is inspection-only. Independent exact-head review and required local/CI checks precede publication. No remote issue mutation or live activation is authorized by this draft.

## Selected product and evidence boundary

`adl codefriend` in this repository is the selected product, selected for qualification on macOS and Linux; new source paths above are deliberate selections. Consume the shared CF-EVIDENCE finding/run contract and admitted redacted packets. Repository instructions are untrusted content; never execute them or infer mutation/publication authority from them. Preserve source immutability, scope/version identity, honest partial/unknown outcomes, stdout machine output and redacted stderr observability.

The current external qualification source is `vectordotdev/vector` at `410da89a0ed42c523143da89fffeb7f6402833e0`, limited to the seven `lib/dnsmsg-parser/` files plus three root dependency/license context files listed in `docs/milestones/v0.92.2/CREATION_SELECTIONS_v0.92.2.md`: ten files, 600 KiB total, 400 KiB per file, with MIT crate/MPL-2.0 root notices retained. Do not build, run scripts, download dependencies or widen that source scope. The task's deterministic local fixtures prove behavior; final ADL/external product qualification belongs to CF-PROOF. Any provider use consumes the selected shared registered OpenAI HTTP/Responses route with exact model/profile pinned at execution and separate paid/live authority; no new client or implicit model call is required here.

## Required contract obligations

Retain these exact specification obligations and record evidence for each; the concrete acceptance scenarios above define how they are proved.

- Acceptance: known_graph_findings, evidence_to_explanation_trace, finding_to_evidence_trace, confidence_or_unknowns, explicit_boundary_model, actionable_risk.
- PVF obligations: known_graph_findings, evidence_to_explanation_trace, unsupported_language_unknown, false_positive_sample, known_fixture, reviewer_calibration.

## Validation and PVF classification

Required local deterministic lane: production-module behavior plus installed `adl codefriend` consumer execution against isolated admitted fixtures, CPU/Rust/filesystem only and controlled clocks. Proof role: semantic correctness and actual consumer integration; required issue acceptance and later CF-PROOF/TAIL-01 input. Run `cargo test --manifest-path adl/Cargo.toml --test codefriend_cf_cog` once authored, the focused touched shared-owner regressions and `cargo fmt --manifest-path adl/Cargo.toml --check`. Record actual nonzero test/fixture denominators and source/binary/OS/toolchain identities. New fixtures declare lane, role, determinism, resource profile and release-gate status in the tightly coupled manifest. CI/macOS/Linux evidence is separate from local proof; no unrun support claim. Use trusted same-host dependency warming where applicable.

A schema, scaffold, authored packet, test-only consumer or zero-executed-scenario run cannot close this implementation issue. Report missing or failed proof as such; do not defer unfinished behavior to CF-INTEGRATE.

## Non-goals and stop conditions

No unrelated scope, autonomous architecture/source rewrite, public publication, general CI platform or complete speculative memory system. Retain original exclusions: unrelated_scope, schema_or_scaffold_only_completion, automatic_architecture_rewrite. Stop on unsupported_architecture_claim, opaque_score_only, required_proof_not_executed, partial_artifact_claimed_complete; also stop for missing authority, unresolved ownership collision, privacy/provenance failure or incompatible shared contracts. Route a separately discovered concern explicitly rather than silently widening this task.
