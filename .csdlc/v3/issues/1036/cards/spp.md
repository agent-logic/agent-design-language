# Structured Plan Prompt

## Plan Summary

Design-time operative plan for `[C-SDLC v3][defect] Adopt bound legacy records into semantic lifecycle state`.

<plan_summary>

## PVF Lane Plan

- Initial PVF lane from issue creation: `<initial_pvf_lane>`
- Planned PVF lane for execution: `<planned_pvf_lane>`
- Planning lane source: `<planned_pvf_lane_source>`
- Revision rule: change `planned_pvf_lane` only when planning discovers a better explicit lane; keep `needs_planning_lane_assignment` fail-closed until that happens.

## Estimate Plan

- Estimated elapsed seconds: `<estimate_elapsed_seconds>`
- Estimated total tokens: `<estimate_total_tokens>`
- Estimated validation seconds: `<estimate_validation_seconds>`
- Issue goal token budget: `<issue_goal_token_budget>`
- Variance threshold percent: `<variance_threshold_percent>`
- Estimate confidence: `<estimate_confidence>`
- Estimate data source: `<estimate_data_source>`
- Estimate source ref: `<estimate_source_ref>`
- Unknown-value rule: record `unknown`, never `0`, when the estimate is unavailable or intentionally deferred.

## Goal Accounting Plan

Carry `issue_goal_ref`, `sprint_goal_ref`, and `goal_metrics_rollup_ref` in frontmatter so later tooling can roll planning and outcome metrics up without duplicating machine-local goal details in prose.

## Codex Plan

1. [<step_1_status>] Confirm dependencies and starting state from the source issue prompt.
2. [<step_2_status>] Inspect repo inputs and target surfaces before editing.
3. [<step_3_status>] Implement the bounded deliverables only.
4. [<step_4_status>] Run focused validation and proof gates.
5. [<step_5_status>] Record issue-specific SRP findings and VPP/SOR outcome truth.

## Assumptions

- The linked source issue prompt, STP, and SIP remain the canonical design-time inputs.

## Proposed Steps

1. Confirm dependency readiness and starting state: Issue #1036 is the bounded tooling repair required before issue #873 can establish semantic proof, review, and publication state.
2. Review repo inputs and scoped surfaces before editing: Issue #1036; merged #1029 unbound legacy preparation behavior; current semantic transaction store; copied bound pre-semantic fixtures matching the #873 lifecycle shape.
3. Implement only the bounded deliverables: Explicit guarded bound-record adoption, byte or digest preservation of retained lifecycle data, coherent interruption recovery, negative identity and ownership guards, and focused native-v3 regression proof.
4. Run focused proof gates for acceptance: Only the exact registered bound record under current authority can be adopted; retained cards and immutable evidence stay preserved; interrupted execution converges once; ordinary semantic status/proof/review/publication intents become available after adoption.
5. Record issue-specific review findings in SRP, validation-planning truth in VPP, issue outcome truth in SOR, and refresh this SPP if execution diverges.

## Affected Areas

- <slug>

## Invariants To Preserve

- Keep SPP issue-local; do not turn it into sprint orchestration.
- Keep VPP as validation-planning truth, SRP as review-result truth, and SOR as output truth.

## Risks And Edge Cases

- <risks_inline>

## Test Strategy

- Run focused issue_1036 tests covering successful adoption, wrong repository/branch/worktree/head/generation/digest rejection, incomplete/damaged/pending/ambiguous state, and interruption recovery; then formatting, diff hygiene, and independent exact-head review.

## Execution Handoff

Use this SPP as the design-time plan-of-record, then hand validation-planning specifics into VPP and update both cards whenever the real execution path diverges.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and re-plan if dependencies are unmet or materially different from this design-time plan.
- Stop and update SPP if touched files, proof gates, or validation commands change materially.
- Stop and route follow-on work if acceptance requires scope outside this issue.

## Notes

No raw lifecycle rewrite, inferred proof or review, broad conversion, remote mutation, live writer activation, merge, cleanup, shared stable-binary replacement, or edits to issue #873's worktree.
