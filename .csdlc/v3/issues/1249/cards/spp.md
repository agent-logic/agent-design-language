# Structured Plan Prompt

## Plan Summary

Design-time operative plan for `[v0.93.1][C-SDLC] Admit Node test proof and reconcile operative plan amendments`.

Add guarded Node --test execution and reconcile plan-class card steps, validate focused positive/negative tests, independently review, then publish and unblock1145.

## PVF Lane Plan

- Initial PVF lane from issue creation: `<initial_pvf_lane>`
- Planned PVF lane for execution: `<planned_pvf_lane>`
- Planning lane source: `<planned_pvf_lane_source>`
- Revision rule: change `planned_pvf_lane` only when planning discovers a better explicit lane; keep `needs_planning_lane_assignment` fail-closed until that happens.

## Estimate Plan

- Estimated elapsed seconds: `<estimate_elapsed_seconds>`
- Estimated total tokens: `<estimate_total_tokens>`
- Estimated validation seconds: `<estimate_validation_seconds>`
- Issue goal token budget: `<issue_goal_token_budget>`
- Variance threshold percent: `<variance_threshold_percent>`
- Estimate confidence: `<estimate_confidence>`
- Estimate data source: `<estimate_data_source>`
- Estimate source ref: `<estimate_source_ref>`
- Unknown-value rule: record `unknown`, never `0`, when the estimate is unavailable or intentionally deferred.

## Goal Accounting Plan

Carry `issue_goal_ref`, `sprint_goal_ref`, and `goal_metrics_rollup_ref` in frontmatter so later tooling can roll planning and outcome metrics up without duplicating machine-local goal details in prose.

## Codex Plan

1. [pending] Confirm dependencies and starting state from the source issue prompt.
2. [pending] Inspect repo inputs and target surfaces before editing.
3. [pending] Implement the bounded deliverables only.
4. [pending] Run focused validation and proof gates.
5. [pending] Record issue-specific SRP findings and VPP/SOR outcome truth.

## Assumptions

- The linked source issue prompt, STP, and SIP remain the canonical design-time inputs.

## Proposed Steps

1. Confirm dependency readiness and starting state: Native Cargo proof remains available for this Rust tooling repair; #1145 supplies the concrete reproducer. User authorized separate tooling fix.
2. Review repo inputs and scoped surfaces before editing: csdlc-v3/src/commands/proof/intent.rs; application/intent/local.rs; storage/semantic.rs; native operator docs and installed tests.
3. Implement only the bounded deliverables: Bounded Node test-runner adapter with tracked safe inputs and real outcomes; atomic operative-plan regeneration on verified plan-class SPP amendment.
4. Run focused proof gates for acceptance: Node test proof executes actual nonempty passing tests under existing process/candidate guards; no arbitrary shell/manual receipt bypass; plan amendments update inputs.plan atomically with SPP.
5. Record issue-specific review findings in SRP, validation-planning truth in VPP, issue outcome truth in SOR, and refresh this SPP if execution diverges.

## Affected Areas

- <slug>

## Invariants To Preserve

- Keep SPP issue-local; do not turn it into sprint orchestration.
- Keep VPP as validation-planning truth, SRP as review-result truth, and SOR as output truth.

## Risks And Edge Cases

- <risks_inline>

## Test Strategy

- Focused Cargo unit and installed-command regressions issue1249_; negative empty/skipped/failed/unsafe/stale proof cases; existing Cargo controls.

## Execution Handoff

Use this SPP as the design-time plan-of-record, then hand validation-planning specifics into VPP and update both cards whenever the real execution path diverges.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and re-plan if dependencies are unmet or materially different from this design-time plan.
- Stop and update SPP if touched files, proof gates, or validation commands change materially.
- Stop and route follow-on work if acceptance requires scope outside this issue.

## Notes

No live providers or deployment. Maintain authority, CAS, binding, timeout, output bounds, redaction and independent review. Install isolated candidate only after review.
