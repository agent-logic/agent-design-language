# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- <stp_card>
- <sip_card>
- <vpp_card>

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- The first bounded review found that current inventory markers were being retroactively required for historical persisted orientations and that all six card titles retained v0.92.2. Both findings were corrected. Fresh exact-head review reported no actionable findings.

### Dispositions

- Persisted historical packages now retain schema, envelope, version, source, projection, and digest validation without retroactive current-inventory requirements; candidate and active packages still require exact current inventory. All six cards now identify v0.92.1.

### Recommended Outcome

- pass

## Notes

Final review covered the complete origin/main...HEAD scope, candidate inventory drift rejection, historical dynamic-store upgrade compatibility, milestone planning reconciliation, and lifecycle title consistency.
