# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/stp.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/sip.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/vpp.md

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- Fresh exact-head review of ed970b2443aadd818f02bf482cb29a5aecbaa966 by fresh-session:/root/review_893_clippy_final returned one P2 lifecycle truth finding: `.csdlc/issues/893/cards/sor.values.json` field `validation_commands_inline` still omitted clippy and described the repair as path-extraction-only.

### Dispositions

- Finding accepted and remediated through native SOR value update. `validation_commands_inline` now includes focused tests, fmt, full clippy with denied warnings, and diff hygiene, and names the clippy-only repair after the path-extraction fix.

### Recommended Outcome

- review_required

## Notes

No product-code finding was reported. Because lifecycle truth changed after the review, a fresh exact-head review is required against the new immutable commit before publication/finish.
