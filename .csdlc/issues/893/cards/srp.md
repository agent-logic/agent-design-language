# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/stp.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/sip.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/vpp.md

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- Post-publication PR #1012 CI at ca2e33f62bdcf0c1dedc2d5ee848617c1fc4fc15 failed `adl-rust-fmt-clippy` because `adl/src/codefriend/actions/remediation.rs` used a manual char-comparison closure in `trim_end_matches`.

### Dispositions

- Accepted and remediated as a style-only source change: replaced the closure with `trim_end_matches(['.', ',', ';'])`. Re-ran focused remediation tests, Rust formatting, full clippy with `-D warnings`, and diff hygiene successfully.

### Recommended Outcome

- review_required

## Notes

The prior exact-head PASS is superseded by this source change. A fresh independent exact-head review is required against the new immutable commit before publication/finish.
