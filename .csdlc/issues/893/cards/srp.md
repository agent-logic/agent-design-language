# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/stp.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/sip.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/vpp.md

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- Fresh no-context exact-head review of a7cddf07dea4f557ed089e0be02adffbe3985717 by fresh-session:dbc5ab4c-d227-4810-a553-41b35d812e26 returned PASS with no actionable findings after terminal #894 was merged and the three reviewed #893 corrective commits were forward-reapplied.

### Dispositions

- All prior corrective findings remain remediated. The reviewer verified canonical completed-synthesis admission, exact admitted evidence paths including spaces and root dotfiles, manifest-bound readback, canonical replanning equality, create-only output behavior, intact #894 test-plan and #895 publication routes, and no #896 absorption.

### Recommended Outcome

- pass

## Notes

Fresh exact-head PASS at a7cddf07dea4f557ed089e0be02adffbe3985717. Final combined focused proof passed: codefriend_remediate 9/9, codefriend_testplan 8/8, and codefriend_ux 7/7, plus rustfmt and diff hygiene. Corrective PR #1024 still requires this metadata commit, final metadata-only exact-head review, push, renewed CI, and merge.
