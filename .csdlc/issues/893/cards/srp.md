# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/stp.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/sip.md
- .csdlc/issues/893/cards/vpp.md

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- Final metadata-only review of a9f004da94bfb053d7c24b2b58920f135515f469 by fresh-session:deff830f-e5e9-4730-9d51-d2f6d2d44b47 returned FAIL with one P2 truth mismatch and no product finding: replay_result listed all 24 focused tests while replay_command listed only the remediation suite plus hygiene checks.

### Dispositions

- P2 accepted and remediated through the native SOR editor. replay_command now enumerates the same remediation 9/9, test-plan 8/8, UX 7/7, rustfmt, and exact-range diff proof represented by replay_result. Product parent a7cddf07dea4f557ed089e0be02adffbe3985717 remains unchanged and reviewed PASS.

### Recommended Outcome

- review_required

## Notes

A distinct fresh reviewer must verify the metadata-only generation-16 repair at the new immutable head before push or publication refresh.
