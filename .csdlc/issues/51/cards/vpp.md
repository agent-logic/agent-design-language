## Summary

## Selected Lanes

[

    "lane": "issue-51-focused",

    ],
    "parallel_group": "sprint8-hygiene",
    "defer_reason": "Run after the issue has a bounded candidate diff."
  }
]

## Parallelization

Only declared parallel groups may overlap.

## Budgets

Seconds: 3600

Tokens: 25000

## Commands

- `ruby .csdlc/prepared/issues/51/validate-podcast-coordination.rb`
- `git diff --check`

## Failure Semantics

Fail closed on dependency, ownership, authority, privacy, validation, exact-revision, or review drift; preserve evidence and route separate defects without widening the issue.

## Handoff

Retain typed evidence before convergence.
