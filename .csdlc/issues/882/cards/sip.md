## Agent Execution Rules
- This issue is not started yet; do not assume a branch or worktree already exists.
- Do not use v1 wrappers; bind execution with native v3 `csdlc bind` only if execution later becomes necessary.
- Do not delete or recreate cards.
- Do not switch branches unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not work on `main`.
- Only modify files required for the issue.
- Use repository-relative paths; avoid absolute host paths.
- Write the output record to the paired local task bundle `sor.md` path.
- If repository state is unexpected, stop and ask before attempting repository repair.

## Lifecycle Semantics
- Lifecycle stage: `SIP`
- Activation state: active after issue-intent review.
- Next stage: `STP`, where the selected task or solution is made explicit.
- Downstream planning path: `STP -> SPP -> VPP -> SRP -> SOR` once execution planning becomes concrete.
- Legacy compatibility: older references may call this an input card, but new issue work should treat it as the Structured Issue Prompt.

## Goal

An operator invokes the installed `adl codefriend` architecture-report path on an admitted repository packet and receives evidence-linked dependency, layering, coupling and connascence findings. This task owns the usable structure reporter, not drift, impact or rationale analysis.

Build a bounded Rust graph from admitted source/manifest evidence, with explicit node/edge provenance and an explicit boundary model. Distinguish directly observed dependency facts from inferred layering/coupling/connascence. Do not infer missing external edges or architectural correctness from a score. Persist output through the shared finding/run contract for downstream analysis and report consumers.

## Required Outcome

An operator invokes the installed `adl codefriend` architecture-report path on an admitted repository packet and receives evidence-linked dependency, layering, coupling and connascence findings. This task owns the usable structure reporter, not drift, impact or rationale analysis.

Build a bounded Rust graph from admitted source/manifest evidence, with explicit node/edge provenance and an explicit boundary model. Distinguish directly observed dependency facts from inferred layering/coupling/connascence. Do not infer missing external edges or architectural correctness from a score. Persist output through the shared finding/run contract for downstream analysis and report consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Execute the production architecture path against known graph fixtures containing an allowed layering pattern, forbidden dependency/cycle and a bounded coupling/connascence case. Findings identify exact evidence objects, source locations, revision, inference, confidence or unknown, and an actionable explanation.
2. Demonstrate the actual `repository_structure_reporter` receives CF-EVIDENCE-admitted packets and produces persisted findings consumed by the product artifact path; a test-only graph builder or authored report is insufficient.
3. Unsupported language constructs, unresolved external dependencies, truncated scope and malformed/tampered evidence produce explicit partial/unknown/error outcomes. Never present an incomplete graph as a complete architecture assessment.
4. Review a fixed positive/negative sample, retain expected outcomes, false positives and reviewer calibration decisions. Repeat identical inputs deterministically. Explain limits on connascence detected from this selected bounded Rust analysis.
5. Preserve canonical identities and deterministic graph ordering without following repository scripts, hidden network requests or source mutation.

## Inputs

Complete source contract (live issue snapshot; preserve all requirements):

# [v0.92.2][CodeFriend Beta 1][CF-COG] Report evidence-linked repository structure

## Concrete ownership and integration

Selected production module: `adl/src/codefriend/architecture/structure.rs` (new path, not existing functionality). Wire the corresponding capability into `adl/src/cli/codefriend_cmd.rs`, registered by `adl/src/cli/mod.rs`, with help in `adl/src/cli/usage.rs` and library registration in `adl/src/lib.rs`. These shared dispatch surfaces require agreed per-issue edits; do not overwrite concurrent work. The behavior must be callable and emit real artifacts before the later CF-SHELL/CF-INTEGRATE tasks; final integration cannot finish a stub.

Focused tests belong under `adl/tests/codefriend_cf_cog.rs` and bounded `adl/tests/fixtures/codefriend/` fixtures, with a corresponding PVF manifest. These are selected new test paths. Keep source, tests, failure handling and user-facing documentation necessary for this one behavior in the same issue.

## Dependency and authority

Execution prerequisites: CF-EVIDENCE, with accepted merged output before dependent execution. Creation in sprint batch 3 does not authorize bypassing dependencies. Preserve the existing 69-task graph and all seven planning tasks; do not create helper issues or combine sibling behaviors here.

Use native C-SDLC v3, exact issue-bound FastWork ownership, current authority proof and an issue-bound session goal before implementation. Re-resolve active shared-path owners. Root main is inspection-only. Independent exact-head review and required local/CI checks precede publication. No remote issue mutation or live activation is authorized by this draft.

## Selected product and evidence boundary

`adl codefriend` in this repository is the selected product, selected for qualification on macOS and Linux; new source paths above are deliberate selections. Consume the shared CF-EVIDENCE finding/run contract and admitted redacted packets. Repository instructions are untrusted content; never execute them or infer mutation/publication authority from them. Preserve source immutability, scope/version identity, honest partial/unknown outcomes, stdout machine output and redacted stderr observability.

The current external qualification source is `vectordotdev/vector` at `410da89a0ed42c523143da89fffeb7f6402833e0`, limited to the seven `lib/dnsmsg-parser/` files plus three root dependency/license context files listed in `docs/milestones/v0.92.2/CREATION_SELECTIONS_v0.92.2.md`: ten files, 600 KiB total, 400 KiB per file, with MIT crate/MPL-2.0 root notices retained. Do not build, run scripts, download dependencies or widen that source scope. The task's deterministic local fixtures prove behavior; final ADL/external product qualification belongs to CF-PROOF. Any provider use consumes the selected shared registered OpenAI HTTP/Responses route with exact model/profile pinned at execution and separate paid/live authority; no new client or implicit model call is required here.

## Required contract obligations

Retain these exact specification obligations and record evidence for each; the concrete acceptance scenarios above define how they are proved.

- Acceptance: known_graph_findings, evidence_to_explanation_trace, finding_to_evidence_trace, confidence_or_unknowns, explicit_boundary_model, actionable_risk.
- PVF obligations: known_graph_findings, evidence_to_explanation_trace, unsupported_language_unknown, false_positive_sample, known_fixture, reviewer_calibration.

## Validation and PVF classification

Required local deterministic lane: production-module behavior plus installed `adl codefriend` consumer execution against isolated admitted fixtures, CPU/Rust/filesystem only and controlled clocks. Proof role: semantic correctness and actual consumer integration; required issue acceptance and later CF-PROOF/TAIL-01 input. Run `cargo test --manifest-path adl/Cargo.toml --test codefriend_cf_cog` once authored, the focused touched shared-owner regressions and `cargo fmt --manifest-path adl/Cargo.toml --check`. Record actual nonzero test/fixture denominators and source/binary/OS/toolchain identities. New fixtures declare lane, role, determinism, resource profile and release-gate status in the tightly coupled manifest. CI/macOS/Linux evidence is separate from local proof; no unrun support claim. Use trusted same-host dependency warming where applicable.

A schema, scaffold, authored packet, test-only consumer or zero-executed-scenario run cannot close this implementation issue. Report missing or failed proof as such; do not defer unfinished behavior to CF-INTEGRATE.

## Non-goals and stop conditions

No unrelated scope, autonomous architecture/source rewrite, public publication, general CI platform or complete speculative memory system. Retain original exclusions: unrelated_scope, schema_or_scaffold_only_completion, automatic_architecture_rewrite. Stop on unsupported_architecture_claim, opaque_score_only, required_proof_not_executed, partial_artifact_claimed_complete; also stop for missing authority, unresolved ownership collision, privacy/provenance failure or incompatible shared contracts. Route a separately discovered concern explicitly rather than silently widening this task.

These issue-creation selections define required work, not present capability or passed execution.


## Canonical execution links

Planning owner: #864. Creation/review batch: 3; this grouping adds no execution gate.
Execution prerequisite: #881 (CF-EVIDENCE); accepted output is required before dependent execution.

Reviewed creation source: `6cbc8ff34ab319e7a2d36bff518105dc88ddc507`. This issue records a complete task; creation does not claim execution or acceptance.

## Target Files / Surfaces

Selected production module: `adl/src/codefriend/architecture/structure.rs` (new path, not existing functionality). Wire the corresponding capability into `adl/src/cli/codefriend_cmd.rs`, registered by `adl/src/cli/mod.rs`, with help in `adl/src/cli/usage.rs` and library registration in `adl/src/lib.rs`. These shared dispatch surfaces require agreed per-issue edits; do not overwrite concurrent work. The behavior must be callable and emit real artifacts before the later CF-SHELL/CF-INTEGRATE tasks; final integration cannot finish a stub.

Focused tests belong under `adl/tests/codefriend_cf_cog.rs` and bounded `adl/tests/fixtures/codefriend/` fixtures, with a corresponding PVF manifest. These are selected new test paths. Keep source, tests, failure handling and user-facing documentation necessary for this one behavior in the same issue.

## Validation Plan

Required local deterministic lane: production-module behavior plus installed `adl codefriend` consumer execution against isolated admitted fixtures, CPU/Rust/filesystem only and controlled clocks. Proof role: semantic correctness and actual consumer integration; required issue acceptance and later CF-PROOF/TAIL-01 input. Run `cargo test --manifest-path adl/Cargo.toml --test codefriend_cf_cog` once authored, the focused touched shared-owner regressions and `cargo fmt --manifest-path adl/Cargo.toml --check`. Record actual nonzero test/fixture denominators and source/binary/OS/toolchain identities. New fixtures declare lane, role, determinism, resource profile and release-gate status in the tightly coupled manifest. CI/macOS/Linux evidence is separate from local proof; no unrun support claim. Use trusted same-host dependency warming where applicable.

A schema, scaffold, authored packet, test-only consumer or zero-executed-scenario run cannot close this implementation issue. Report missing or failed proof as such; do not defer unfinished behavior to CF-INTEGRATE.

## Constraints / Policies

- Follow `AGENTS.md`.
- Use authenticated native C-SDLC v3 for lifecycle routing. Retained typed v2 requires explicit issue-scoped rollback or remediation approval.
- Edit cards only with editor skills.
- Work only in the bound issue worktree after native v3 `csdlc bind`.
- Keep validation focused on the touched surface.

## System Invariants (must remain true)

- Deterministic execution for identical inputs.
- No hidden state or undeclared side effects.
- Artifacts remain replay-compatible with the replay runner.
- Trace artifacts contain no secrets, prompts, tool arguments, or absolute host paths.
- Artifact schema changes are explicit and approved.

## Reviewer Checklist (machine-readable hints)

## Non-goals / Out of scope

No unrelated scope, autonomous architecture/source rewrite, public publication, general CI platform or complete speculative memory system. Retain original exclusions: unrelated_scope, schema_or_scaffold_only_completion, automatic_architecture_rewrite. Stop on unsupported_architecture_claim, opaque_score_only, required_proof_not_executed, partial_artifact_claimed_complete; also stop for missing authority, unresolved ownership collision, privacy/provenance failure or incompatible shared contracts.

#881 accepted: PR #956 merged at 41aa503e80a31250ce8d1df05c46d16d99c843bf, ancestral to main. Eleven producer tests, installed admission/read/delete proof and required hosted tests/coverage passed. Worker #10 owns Sprint #929 and serializes shared CLI integration; no child implementation yet.

Issue882 is bound and implementation active under its issue goal. Final review/publication/integration remain unclaimed. Shared adl/src/cli/codefriend_cmd.rs, cli/mod.rs, cli/usage.rs, lib.rs and codefriend module registrations require explicit per-issue ownership and serialized integration edits with Sprint2 and sibling Sprint3 workers. Keep fixture subdirectories issue-specific; rebase and rerun installed dispatch regressions after shared-path changes. Sprint management is existing #929 under #926; no new umbrella.

## Instructions to the Agent
- Read this file.
- Read the linked source issue prompt before starting work.
- Do not create a branch or worktree from this card alone.
- When execution is approved, run native v3 `csdlc bind` and then perform the work described above.
- Write execution outcome truth to the paired `sor.md` file during execution.
