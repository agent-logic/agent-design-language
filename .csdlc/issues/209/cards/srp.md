## Prompts

- Does the test exercise the real Guardian/kernel operation path rather than a service-local ACK?
- Can any principal/session sequence choice deny or authorize unrelated traffic?
- Does bounded pressure preserve replay and operation state while returning the declared typed error?
- Are OpenAPI required/nullability rules identical to runtime admission?
- Are exact native receipts bound to every authority-bearing source and test path?

## Findings

[]

## Dispositions

Every actionable finding requires a terminal disposition.

## Residual Risk

- Fresh exact Linux and macOS native receipts and the aggregate validator remain required on the next published head; merge remains prohibited until those checks are green and operator review is complete.
