# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- <stp_card>
- <sip_card>
- <vpp_card>

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- No actionable findings after marking historical setup handoff, documenting retained source DNS exception and verifying existing company contacts and standard registrar renewal notification path.

### Dispositions

- All preparation review observations resolved; no remaining migration or privacy findings. Corporate DNS is explicitly deferred under owner-approved retained-zone exception for v0.93 website work. No custom notification-delivery proof claimed.

### Recommended Outcome

- approve

## Notes

Independent reviewer /root/review_1017 reviewed exact implementation revision 65f0ef34df5509e5f99e74f8a1c80d5d31b9438b, compared private live AWS evidence and reviewed 42 committed files for privacy. Six native projection tests passed separately.
