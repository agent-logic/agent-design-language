## Agent Execution Rules
- This issue is not started yet; do not assume a branch or worktree already exists.
- Do not use v1 wrappers; bind execution with native v3 `csdlc bind` only if execution later becomes necessary.
- Do not delete or recreate cards.
- Do not switch branches unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not work on `main`.
- Only modify files required for the issue.
- Use repository-relative paths; avoid absolute host paths.
- Write the output record to the paired local task bundle `sor.md` path.
- If repository state is unexpected, stop and ask before attempting repository repair.

## Lifecycle Semantics
- Lifecycle stage: `SIP`
- Activation state: active after issue-intent review.
- Next stage: `STP`, where the selected task or solution is made explicit.
- Downstream planning path: `STP -> SPP -> VPP -> SRP -> SOR` once execution planning becomes concrete.
- Legacy compatibility: older references may call this an input card, but new issue work should treat it as the Structured Issue Prompt.

## Execution
- Agent:
- Provider:
- Tools allowed:
- Sandbox / approvals:
- Source issue-prompt slug: v0922-closeout-plan
- Required outcome type: documentation
- Demo required: false

## Goal

Produce one reviewed v0.92.2 closeout and release-tail plan.

## Required Outcome

One validated, independently reviewed, number-free v0.92.2 planning package with explicit release-tail and TBD scheduling truth.

## Acceptance Criteria

The canonical denominator, dependencies, gates, tail order, asynchronous closeout rule, and operator-authorized TBD dispositions are explicit and consistent across every canonical planning surface.

## Inputs

Issue #524; merged #523/PR #743; v0.92.1 release-tail standards; operator-authorized TBD schedules.

## Target Files / Surfaces

docs/milestones/v0.92.2 planning package and issue-local lifecycle/evidence surfaces.

## Validation Plan

Run the focused v0.92.2 planning validator with negative fixtures, exact diff hygiene, residual denominator scans, and fresh independent exact-head review.

## Demo / Proof Requirements

Not applicable: documentation-planning issue with deterministic structural validation.

## Constraints / Policies

- Follow `AGENTS.md`.
- Use authenticated native C-SDLC v3 for lifecycle routing. Retained typed v2 requires explicit issue-scoped rollback or remediation approval.
- Edit cards only with editor skills.
- Work only in the bound issue worktree after native v3 `csdlc bind`.
- Keep validation focused on the touched surface.

## System Invariants (must remain true)

- Deterministic execution for identical inputs.
- No hidden state or undeclared side effects.
- Artifacts remain replay-compatible with the replay runner.
- Trace artifacts contain no secrets, prompts, tool arguments, or absolute host paths.
- Artifact schema changes are explicit and approved.

## Reviewer Checklist (machine-readable hints)
```yaml
determinism_required: true
network_allowed: false
artifact_schema_change: false
replay_required: true
security_sensitive: true
ci_validation_required: true
```

## Card Automation Hooks (prompt generation)
- Prompt source fields:
  - Goal
  - Required Outcome
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Inputs
  - Target Files / Surfaces
  - Validation Plan
  - Demo / Proof Requirements
  - Constraints / Policies
  - System Invariants
  - Reviewer Checklist
- Generation requirements:
  - Deterministic output for identical SIP content
  - No secrets, tokens, or absolute host paths in generated prompt text
  - Preserve traceability back to the source issue prompt
  - Preserve explicit required-outcome and demo/proof requirements

## Non-goals / Out of scope

No v0.92.2 issue creation, cloud mutation, experiment execution, release action, merge, or closeout ceremony.

## Notes / Risks

Ignored TBD files remain source references and are not copied into the tracked package; planning does not authorize their execution.

## Instructions to the Agent
- Read this file.
- Read the linked source issue prompt before starting work.
- Do not create a branch or worktree from this card alone.
- When execution is approved, run native v3 `csdlc bind` and then perform the work described above.
- Write execution outcome truth to the paired `sor.md` file during execution.
