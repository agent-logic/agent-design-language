# Structured Review Prompt

## Review Summary

Use this prompt to govern the independent pre-PR review for this issue. Review results are intentionally absent before implementation exists and must be finalized before PR publication.

## Scope Basis

- <stp_card>
- <sip_card>
- <vpp_card>

## In-Scope Surfaces

- tracked changes for this issue branch

## Evidence Rules

- Use repository evidence, targeted validation output, and linked issue-bundle artifacts only.

## Validation Inputs

- Issue-local proofs recorded in the VPP and SOR.

## Allowed Dispositions

- PASS
- BLOCK
- NEEDS_FOLLOWUP

## Reviewer Constraints

- Do not widen issue scope.
- Do not merge, publish, or close the issue.

## Refusal Policy

- Refuse claims that are unsupported by repository evidence.
- Refuse approving behavior outside the recorded issue scope.

## Follow-up Routing

- Route actionable defects back to the issue branch before PR publication.

## Non-Claims

- This prompt does not claim review has already run.
- This prompt does not guarantee review quality by itself.

## Review Results

When finalizing review, record the machine-readable review result in frontmatter:

```yaml
review_results:
  findings_status: "no_findings | findings_present | review_unavailable | review_timeout | review_cancelled | review_failed"
  recommended_outcome: "pass | block | needs_followup"
```

### Findings

- Preparation review found incorrect #819 ancestry; fixed after verifying PR827 merge ancestor. Follow-up preparation review found no actionable findings.

### Dispositions

- Resolved ancestry wording. Final candidate execution, exact-head acceptance and release recommendation remain pending.

### Recommended Outcome

- needs_followup

## Notes

review_821_preparation reviewed preparation only, including four-row identity, finding inputs and truthful proof boundaries. Final draft-publication exact-head review is in progress; this card does not approve final gate acceptance.
